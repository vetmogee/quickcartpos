i need to create a cash register pos system in my react project, i have a app.jsx file and 
./pages.pos.jsx file where i want to create the cash register system so i can route it into 
a different link dirrectory in my project, i want the system to be split into 3 different sections 
horizontally where the first section would be a menu bar which will have buttons on top of each other verically, 
the second section would be a total list of items, the second section will also be split in 3 sections 
which will go from top to bottom like this top = order total,  middle = last item scanned, bottom = all items scanned, 
the third section is also going to be split into 2 sections on top of each other where the one on top 
will be a fast select menu that will have items selected by the user to be added to the all scanned item list 
and the bottom part will be a numberpad so the user can type in the barcode numbers that will be in a 3:4 order 
with number nine being in the top right corner and 1 being in the first place in the second to last row 
number 0 will be in the middle of the last row with a  comma button on the left of number 0 and enter button will be on the right of number 0
